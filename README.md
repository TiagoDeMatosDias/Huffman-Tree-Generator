# Huffman-Tree-Generator

This short program using nodejs takes a text input of arbitrary length, and generates its corresponding huffman tree. This may later be used to compress the text in the mathematically optimal way.

# How to Use

Simply rename the text file you wish to compress into "Input.txt", and run the code. The "Output.txt" file contains the "character<->binary" combination for every character used in the input.
